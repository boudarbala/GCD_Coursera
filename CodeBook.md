Script "run_analysis.R" doing next steps for cleaning data:

The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

* Merges the training and test sets to create one data set

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
